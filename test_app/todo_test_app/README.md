# todo_test_app

## Running the app

To run the project, you must run the command `npm run serve` in the command line or use the `vue ui` command and link the project to it and run it on the interface.

## Front page

Once the app is running, you will be greeted by a front page divided in two parts, one is named "Home", and the other one is named "Add Todo".

You can click on "Add Todo" to list a new todo element, and change its state (wether it is complete or if you want to delete it).

Note that you cannot add an empty todo element.

## Additional Notes

This project might contain errors with the webpacks (as it is my first time having to setup with vue I had a few struggles to setup the environnement and as such the project is quite lackluster).
